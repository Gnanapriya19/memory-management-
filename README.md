IMPLEMENTATION OF MEMORY ALLOCATION TECHNIQUES
AIM:
To write a C program to implement Memory Management concept using the
technique best fit, worst fit and first fit algorithms.
ALGORITHM:
1.	Get the number of process.
2.	Get the number of blocks and size of process.
3.	Get the choices from the user and call the corresponding switch cases.
4.	First fit -allocate the process to the available free block match with the size of the process
5.	Worst fit â€“allocate the process to the largest block size available in the list
6.	Best fit-allocate the process to the optimum size block available in the list
7.	Display the result with allocations
